# Suffix Length Guide - REAL Performance Data

## ⚠️ Reality Check: Actual vs Theoretical Speed

**Theoretical speed** (no crypto): 1+ billion attempts/second  
**Real speed with scrypt** (N=262144): **~10-100 attempts/second**

This is a **10 million times** slowdown due to the memory-hard scrypt function used by Ethereum wallets.

## Available Commands

```bash
# Default (tries both 4 and 5 character suffixes)
make crack

# Specific suffix lengths
make crack-3   # 3 characters only
make crack-4   # 4 characters only  
make crack-5   # 5 characters only
make crack-6   # 6 characters only

# Custom length (1-12 characters)
docker exec cryptocracker ./build/cryptocracker \
  --wallet /app/wallets/wallet.json \
  --passwords /app/config/passwords.txt \
  --suffix-length 7
```

## REAL Time Estimates for 13 Passwords

### With Ethereum Mist Wallets (scrypt N=262144, r=8, p=1)

Based on **actual measured performance** on RTX 3080:

| Suffix Length | Total Combinations | Time @ 10/sec | Time @ 100/sec | Recommendation |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 char | 1,222 | **2 minutes** | **12 seconds** | ✅ Try this first |
| 2 chars | 114,868 | **3.2 hours** | **19 minutes** | ✅ Reasonable |
| 3 chars | 10.8 million | **12.5 days** | **30 hours** | ⚠️ Be patient |
| 4 chars | 1 billion | **3.2 years** | **116 days** | ❌ Impractical |
| 5 chars | 95 billion | **301 years** | **30 years** | ❌ Impossible |
| 6 chars | 8.9 trillion | **28,247 years** | **2,825 years** | ❌ Impossible |
| 7 chars | 842 trillion | **2.6 million years** | **266,000 years** | ❌ Impossible |
| 8 chars | 79 quadrillion | **250 million years** | **25 million years** | ❌ Impossible |

### With Older Wallets (PBKDF2, c=4096)

If your wallet uses PBKDF2 instead of scrypt (~10,000 attempts/sec):

| Suffix Length | Total Combinations | Time Estimate | Recommendation |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 char | 1,222 | **< 1 second** | ✅ Instant |
| 2 chars | 114,868 | **11 seconds** | ✅ Very fast |
| 3 chars | 10.8 million | **18 minutes** | ✅ Quick |
| 4 chars | 1 billion | **28 hours** | ⚠️ Overnight |
| 5 chars | 95 billion | **110 days** | ❌ Months |
| 6 chars | 8.9 trillion | **28 years** | ❌ Impractical |

## How to Check Your Wallet Type

Look in your wallet.json file for the `kdf` field:

```json
{
  "crypto": {
    "kdf": "scrypt",        // <- Slow (Mist wallets)
    "kdfparams": {
      "n": 262144,          // <- This makes it VERY slow
      "r": 8,
      "p": 1
    }
  }
}
```

vs

```json
{
  "crypto": {
    "kdf": "pbkdf2",        // <- 1000x faster
    "kdfparams": {
      "c": 4096             // <- Much smaller iteration count
    }
  }
}
```

## Realistic Recommendations

### If You Have a Mist Wallet (scrypt)

1. **Only attempt if missing 1-2 characters** (minutes to hours)
2. **3 characters is borderline** (2 weeks of continuous running)
3. **4+ characters is effectively impossible** (years to centuries)

### If You Have a PBKDF2 Wallet

1. **1-3 characters are very feasible** (seconds to minutes)
2. **4 characters possible with patience** (1-2 days)
3. **5 characters challenging but doable** (3-4 months)
4. **6+ characters impractical** (decades)

## Examples of What's Realistic

### ✅ Feasible Scenarios
- You typed `mypassword` but added 1-2 characters you forgot
- You know it's `cashfl0w` plus a year like `21` or `22`
- Testing variations like `Password`, `password`, `PASSWORD`

### ⚠️ Challenging But Possible
- Missing 3 random characters with PBKDF2 wallet
- Missing 2 characters with scrypt wallet
- Testing 50 base passwords with 2-character suffixes

### ❌ Practically Impossible
- Missing 4+ characters with scrypt wallet
- Missing 6+ characters with any wallet
- No knowledge of base password

## Pro Tips for Success

1. **Start with 1 character** - Takes only minutes, might get lucky
2. **Try common patterns first**:
   - Years: `21`, `22`, `2016`, `2024`
   - Common suffixes: `123`, `!`, `1`, `01`
   - Repeated characters: `!!`, `00`, `aa`
3. **Reduce base passwords** - Each one multiplies the time
4. **Check wallet type** - PBKDF2 is 1000x faster than scrypt
5. **Use checkpoints** - Long runs can be interrupted

## Character Set (94 total)

The suffix uses all these characters:
- Lowercase: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` (26)
- Uppercase: `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ` (26)  
- Numbers: `0123456789` (10)
- Symbols: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?/~`` (32)

## The Math Behind the Times

For scrypt with 13 passwords and ~10 attempts/second:
- 1 char: 94¹ × 13 ÷ 10 = 122 seconds
- 2 chars: 94² × 13 ÷ 10 = 11,487 seconds (3.2 hours)
- 3 chars: 94³ × 13 ÷ 10 = 1,079,759 seconds (12.5 days)
- 4 chars: 94⁴ × 13 ÷ 10 = 101,497,384 seconds (3.2 years)

Each additional character multiplies the time by 94!

## Bottom Line

**For Mist wallets (scrypt):** Only practical if missing 1-2 characters  
**For older wallets (PBKDF2):** Feasible up to 4-5 characters with patience

The wallet encryption was designed to make brute-force attacks impractical, and it succeeds.
